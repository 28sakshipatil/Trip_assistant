## 🧩 Core Concepts Explained

### 🔹 Frontend (`client/`)

| File/Folder         | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| `src/App.tsx`       | Root component for routing & layout |
| `components/`       | Reusable UI elements like navbar, chatbot, footer |
| `pages/`            | Page-specific views like `home`, `Places`, `Admin` |
| `utils/`            | Utility functions (e.g. toasts, error handling) |
| `i18n.js`           | Multi-language setup using `react-i18next` |
| `assets/images/`    | Site visuals used in pages and UI |
| `responsive.css`    | Custom CSS for mobile responsiveness |

> Tip: Learn how routing and lazy loading is done in `App.tsx`.

---

### 🔹 Backend (`server/`)

| File             | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| `server.js`      | Main Express server with MongoDB connection |
| `routes/`        | (If added) Contains API route files (e.g. `/places`, `/users`) |
| `controllers/`   | (Optional) Logic separated from routes for clean code |
| `models/`        | Mongoose schemas (e.g. Place, Booking, User) |

> Make sure you understand how MongoDB connection is initialized in `server.js`.

---

### 🔹 Authentication

- Uses **Firebase Authentication** for:
  - Sign up / Sign in with email
  - Secure session management
- Firebase config is added in frontend, and optionally used on backend if needed.

---

### 🔹 AI Chatbot Integration

- The chatbot component (`chatbot.tsx`) sends user queries to an API endpoint.
- You can connect it with OpenAI, LangChain, or a custom model.
- Check how messages are managed and styled in `Message.tsx`.

---

## 🌍 i18n - Multilingual Support

- Implemented via `react-i18next`
- English, Hindi, and French are supported
- Strings are defined in locale files and translated using `t('key')`

---

## 🧪 Testing the App

```bash
# Frontend
cd client
npm install
npm run dev

# Backend (in a separate terminal)
cd server
npm install
npm start
````

* App runs on: `http://localhost:5173`
* API runs on: `http://localhost:5000`

Ensure your MongoDB and Firebase setup is ready before launching.
